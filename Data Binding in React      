                        Data Binding in React                            
- Data Binding is a technique used in web applications, where data is accessed from a source and updated into UI.
- JavaScript depends on lot of DOM manipulations to handle data binding.
- JavaScript required lot of event binding techniques to bind data.
- React uses simple data binding expression that can bind data to UI.
- The data binding expression in react is configured with " {   } ".

Syntax:
        var  userName = "John";

        <p> Hello ! { userName } </p>

- Data Binding in applications is classified into 2 types

    1. One Way Binding
    2. Two Way Binding
    
- React supports only One Way Binding
- One Way Binding is a technique where data is accessed from source and update to UI. Any modification in UI will not update back into source.
- Two Way Binding allows to access data from source and bind to UI. It identifies the changes in UI and updates back to source.
- React requires event binding techniques to handle 2 way binding explicitly.
- One Way Binding is fast and secured.

Syntax:
    var userName = "John";

    <input type="text"  value={userName} />    => Not editable
