React Render HTML
React's goal is in many ways to render HTML in a web page.

React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called createRoot() and its method render().

The createRoot Function
The createRoot() function takes one argument, an HTML element.

The purpose of the function is to define the HTML element where a React component should be displayed.

The render Method
The render() method is then called to define the React component that should be rendered.

But render where?

There is another folder in the root directory of your React project, named "public". In this folder, there is an index.html file.

You'll notice a single <div> in the body of this file. This is where our React application will be rendered.

ExampleGet your own React.js Server
Display a paragraph inside an element with the id of "root":

const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(<p>Hello</p>);
The result is displayed in the <div id="root"> element:

<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
The HTML Code
The HTML code in this tutorial uses JSX which allows you to write HTML tags inside the JavaScript code:

Do not worry if the syntax is unfamiliar, you will learn more about JSX in the next chapter.

Example
Create a variable that contains HTML code and display it in the "root" node:

const myelement = (
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>John</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Elsa</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
);

const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(myelement);

The Root Node
The root node is the HTML element where you want to display the result.

It is like a container for content managed by React.

It does NOT have to be a <div> element and it does NOT have to have the id='root':

Example
The root node can be called whatever you like:

<body>

  <header id="sandy"></header>

</body>
Display the result in the <header id="sandy"> element:

const container = document.getElementById('sandy');
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(<p>Hallo</p>);
